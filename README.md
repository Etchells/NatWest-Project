# NatWest-Project

Why are we doing this?
-To test our knowledge. After only 6 ish weeks can we build a database and maintain the data through a frontend HTML.

How I expected the challege to go.
-Initial thoughts...... Oh S#!t 
-But I'd had enjoyed learning all this stuff todate even though its been stressfull most days.

What went well?
-Set up on the datebase went well.

What didn't go as planned?
-Two of my custom @Query didn't work initially on Postman, but after stepping back for a break the solution came to me. (This might be more of a 'what went well' moment)

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
-As the Hitchhickers Guide to the Galaxy once said....Don't Panic.
