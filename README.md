Why are we doing this?

-To test our knowledge. After only 6 ish weeks can we build a database and maintain the data through a frontend HTML.


How I expected the challege to go.

-Initial thoughts...... Oh S#!t 

-But I'd had enjoyed learning all this stuff todate even though its been stressfull most days.


What went well?

-Set up on the datebase went well.

-All GRUD elements tested through Postman and are OK!

-I set my Java Springboot project to insert some database records at startup. (something that we weren't taught properly)


What didn't go as planned?

-Two of my custom @Query didn't work initially on Postman, but after stepping back for a break the solution came to me. (This might be more of a 'what went well' moment)

-When testing my first GET response by browser console reported a CORS error. After a full day of searching for solutions with browser extensions, one forum pointed to adding 
an addition annotation to the Controller called @CrossOrigin. This solved the problem.

-Clicking on Delete on my browser causes a 'Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input at line 60. But on second click it works. So i haven't a clue what the problem is.

-My html links to my .js and .css files don't aways seem to load through, so I have to keep re-linking the files and saving again for the html document to work.


Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

-As the Hitchhickers Guide to the Galaxy once said....Don't Panic.

-When finding prolems and no solutions straight away I find I start something else then loose where am up to when going back. I should set a stardard work approach.
